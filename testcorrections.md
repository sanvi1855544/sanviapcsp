12.

Correct Answer- A : I only


Reflection: I put C : I and III only. But III doesn’t work in this context because even though the new system captures the phone number, the phone number is not needed to direct a call to the appropriate destination.


23.

Correct Answer- A: A group of cookies stored by the user’s Web browser

Reflection: I put B: The internet protocol (IP) address of the user’s computer. I put an IP address because I thought it is an indicator of a person’s identity. However, the IP address of a computer doesn’t have extra information about the user. The information in cookies can be used by the website that the user visits to track the user and collect information about the user.


27.

Correct Answer - B: How many states have a higher percentage of female computer science majors than male computer science majors attending college in that state?

Reflection: I put A: Do students majoring in computer science tend to have higher grade point averages than students majoring in other subjects? which is wrong because we don’t have information about the other majors. B is correct because the data set has information on state and gender and this can extract how many female majors are in the state.


29.

Correct Answer - C: The conclusion is not right, using the test case [0, 1, 4, 5] is not sufficient to conclude the program is right.

Reflection: I put A: The conclusion is correct; the program works as intended. This is because for the FOR EACH loop which counts each element twice. I thought it was a FOR loop so silly mistake.






32.

Correct Answer - C: Moving the statement in line 5 so that it appears between lines 2 and 3

Reflection: I put B: Changing line 6 to IF(myList[item] = val) which is wrong because I didn’t notice the FOR EACH loop. The count = 0 must be pulled out of the FOR EACH loop so that it isn’t constantly set to 0.



48.

Correct Answer - A: 2

Reflection: I put B: 3 which is wrong because 2 is the minimum. 3 would prevent communication between A and F but this is not min. Look at the nodes of the destination. There are 2 notes. Removing the connections between C and F and between F and H will prevent A and F from communicating.
