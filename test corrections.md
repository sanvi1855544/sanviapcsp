12.

Correct Answer- A : I only


Reflection: I put C : I and III only. But III doesn’t work in this context because even though the new system captures the phone number, the phone number is not needed to direct a call to the appropriate destination.


23.

Correct Answer- A: A group of cookies stored by the user’s Web browser

Reflection: I put B: The internet protocol (IP) address of the user’s computer. I put an IP address because I thought it is an indicator of a person’s identity. However, the IP address of a computer doesn’t have extra information about the user. The information in cookies can be used by the website that the user visits to track the user and collect information about the user.


27.

Correct Answer - B: How many states have a higher percentage of female computer science majors than male computer science majors attending college in that state?

Reflection: I put A: Do students majoring in computer science tend to have higher grade point averages than students majoring in other subjects? which is wrong because we don’t have information about the other majors. B is correct because the data set has information on state and gender and this can extract how many female majors are in the state.


29.

Correct Answer - C: The conclusion is not right, using the test case [0, 1, 4, 5] is not sufficient to conclude the program is right.

Reflection: I put A: The conclusion is correct; the program works as intended. This is because for the FOR EACH loop which counts each element twice. I thought it was a FOR loop so silly mistake.






32.

Correct Answer - C: Moving the statement in line 5 so that it appears between lines 2 and 3

Reflection: I put B: Changing line 6 to IF(myList[item] = val) which is wrong because I didn’t notice the FOR EACH loop. The count = 0 must be pulled out of the FOR EACH loop so that it isn’t constantly set to 0.



48.

Correct Answer - A: 2

Reflection: I put B: 3 which is wrong because 2 is the minimum. 3 would prevent communication between A and F but this is not min. Look at the nodes of the destination. There are 2 notes. Removing the connections between C and F and between F and H will prevent A and F from communicating.


Test 2: 45/50

1. 
Correct Answer - D: the efficiency of a solution that can be brokek down into parallel protions is still limited by a sequential portion

Reflection: I put B: Any solution can be broken down into smaller and smaller portions, making the improvement in efficiency theoretically limitless as long as there are enough processors available. but this is wrong because the efifcieny will eventually be limited by the sequential portion. D is correct because it recognizes that parallel computing is limited by the parallel portion and sequential portion.

25.
Correct Answer - C: Users of the application may see health benefits as a result of the application encouraging them to excercise with each other. 

Reflection: I put B: Users of the application may be able to easily identify all other users in a particular area as a result of the application's algorithm for determining whether users are compatible. This is wrong because the application only sends notification to compatible users nearby. App cannot identify users not in the area. C is right because the app can connect users with other users nearby that encourages users to exercise together (improves user health)


29.
Correct Answer - A: Points of interest may be more densely located in cities, favoring players in urban areas over players in rural areas.

Reflection: I put C:Special items may not be useful to all players, favoring players in urban areas over players in rural areas. This is wrong because the special items are not affected by the players' locations. A is correct because urban areas would have more points of interest and so people living in these urban areas can more access to benefits.

40.
Correct Answer - D: The image analysis is likely to take a longer time for the research team than for a distributed group of individuals.

Reflection: I put A: Distributed individuals are likely to be more accurate in wildlife identification than the research team. This is wrong because the work may be amateur and may not have the same accuracy as professional researchers. However, the distributed group can be faster (this is the benefit of crowdsourcing)

47.
Correct Answer - A: Participants who read more were generally more likely to say they are interested in the application.

Reflection: I put B: Participants who read more were generally less likely to say they are interested in the application. This is wrong because those who read more are more likely to say they are interested in the application. A is correct (pay attention to what symbols actually mean). 

Test 3: 45/50

6. 
Correct Answer - A and D

Reflection: I only chose answer A. The algorithm for D works as well because the numbers 1-20 are displayed. The number increments to 21 but that causes the algorithm to terminate.

7. 
Correct Answer - D

Reflection: I chose A- The procedure returns nothing because it will not terminate. This is wrong, the algo is without error and returns a value. The procedure sets the result to 1 and j to 2. The procedure would return the sum of the integers from 1 to n.

21. 
Correct Answer - D

Reflection: I chose A which is wrong because overwhelming a system with requests in order to deny service can be done regardless of password strength. 

31. 
Correct Answer - B 

Reflection: I chose D which is wrong because the distance between two numbers cannot be obtained by taking the difference between the AV of the numbers

47. 
Correct Answer - A and D

Reflection: I only chose A but D also works. This code segment sets bonus to score * 10 when score > 100, sets bonus to score when 100 ≥ score ≥ 50, and sets bonus to 0 when score < 50.
