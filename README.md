# Test Prep Study

## 5.1 Notes
- The way people complete tasks changes to incorporate new computing innovations
- Not every effect of computing innovation is anticipated in advance
- A signle effect can be viewed as beneficial and harmful (like drones)
- Advances in computing have sparked creativity in other fields
- World Wide Web was originally intended for rapid and easy exchange of information 
- Targeted advertising is used to help businesses and can be misused at both individual and aggregate levels 
- Machine Learning and Data Mining have enabled innovation in medicine
- Some of the ways computing innovations can be used may have a harmful impact on society, the economy, or culture
- Responsible programmers try to consider unintended ways their computing innovations can be used and potential beneficial and harmful effects of these new uses
- It is not possible for a programer to consider all the ways a computing innovation can be used
- Computing innoivation have often had unintended beneficial effects by leading to advances in other fields
## 5.2 Notes
- Internet access varies between socioeconomic, geographic, and demographic characteristics, as well as between countries
- The "digital divide" refers to differing access to computing devices and the Internet, based on socioeconomic, geographic, or demographic characteristics
- The digital divde raises issues of equity, access, and infuence, both globally and locally
- The digital divide raises issues of equity, access, and influence, both globally and locally
- The digital divide is affected by the actions of individuals, organization, and governments

### Week 1 TPT Actions

#### Tri 3 TPT 0.1 related to Beneficial and Harmful Effects of Computing Big Idea 5.1
1. Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing
     - When the computer saves your password, you won't have to worry about forgetting it but your computer is easier to hack
     - Online AP exams are great in a pandemic but not accessible to those affected by the Digital Divide
     - A smart home can make things easier but can be hacked
3. Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?
     - The Dopamine issues are real. I used to be distracted by reading books instead of doing my homework and a good schedule helped me address this problem
#### Tri 3 TPT 0.2 related to Digital Divide Big Idea 5.2
1. How does someone empower themself in a digital world?
     - Someone can empower themselves in a digital world by having access to devices like computers, phones, and tablet. Something that will empower people even more is
     knowledge of cybersecurity and coding.
2. How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.
     - Something we could do at Del Norte HS is teach free coding classes to people who cannot afford such classes/don't have access to them.
4. Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?
     - Yes, paper and red tape is blocking digital empowerment. At school, the wifi blocks certain websites. In some countries like Russia, the government censors websites and
     foreign content that impedes on people's digital empowerment.
