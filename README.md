## 5.1 Notes
- The way people complete tasks changes to incorporate new computing innovations
- Not every effect of computing innovation is anticipated in advance
- A signle effect can be viewed as beneficial and harmful (like drones)
- Advances in computing have sparked creativity in other fields
- World Wide Web was originally intended for rapid and easy exchange of information 
- Targeted advertising is used to help businesses and can be misused at both individual and aggregate levels 
- Machine Learning and Data Mining have enabled innovation in medicine
- Some of the ways computing innovations can be used may have a harmful impact on society, the economy, or culture
- Responsible programmers try to consider unintended ways their computing innovations can be used and potential beneficial and harmful effects of these new uses
- It is not possible for a programer to consider all the ways a computing innovation can be used
- Computing innoivation have often had unintended beneficial effects by leading to advances in other fields
## 5.2 Notes
- Internet access varies between socioeconomic, geographic, and demographic characteristics, as well as between countries
- The "digital divide" refers to differing access to computing devices and the Internet, based on socioeconomic, geographic, or demographic characteristics
- The digital divde raises issues of equity, access, and infuence, both globally and locally
- The digital divide raises issues of equity, access, and influence, both globally and locally
- The digital divide is affected by the actions of individuals, organization, and governments
## 5.3 Notes
- Computing innocations can reflect existing human biases because of biases written into the algorithms or biases in the data used by the innovation
- Programmers should take action to reduce bias in algorithms used for computing innovations as a way of combating existing human biases
- Biases can be embedded at all levels of software development
## 5.4 Notes
- Widespread access to information and public data facilitates the identification of problems, developments of solutions, and dessemination of results
- Science has been affect by using distributed and "citizen science" to solve scientific problems
- Citizen science is scientific research conducted in whole or part by distributed individuals, many of whom may not be scienctists, who contribute relevant data to research using their own computing devices
- Crowdsourcing is the practice of obtaining input or information from a large number of people via the internet
- Human capabilities can be enhanced by collaboration via computing
- Crowdsourcing offers new models for collaboration, such as connecting businesses or social causes with funding

## 5.5 Notes
- Material made on a computer is intellectual property of the creator or organization
- Ease of access and distribution of digitized information raises intellectual property concernss regarding ownership, value and use
- Measures should be taken to safeguard intellectual property
- The use of material created by someone else without permission and presented as one's own plagiarism and may have legal consequences
- Some examples of legal ways to use materials created by someone else include:
     - Creative Commons - a public copyright license that enables the free distribution of an otherwise copyrighted work. This is used the the content creator wants to give others the right to share, use, and build upon the work they have created
     - open source - online research outputs free of any and all restrictions on access and free of many restrictions on use, such as copyright or license restrictions
-the use of material made by someone should be cited
-Creative Commons, open source and open access have enavled broad access to digital information
- Legal and ethical concerns when using computing to harm individuals or groups
- Computing can play role in social and political issues 
- Digital Divide causes ethical concerns about computing
- Streaming software = legal and ethical concerns
## 5.6 Notes
- Personally identifiable information is infomration about an individual that finds links, relates or describes them
- Search engines can record history of searches
- Websites can record and maintain a history of individuals who have viewed their pages
- Devices, websites, and networks can collect information about a user's location
- Technology enables the collected, use, and exploitation of information
- A malicious link can be disguised on web page or email
- phishing, keylogging, rogue access point are something to be wary of
- unsolicited emails, attachments, links and forms in emails can be used to compromise the security of a system
- untrustworthy (often free) downloads can have malware.
## Github Pages Actions
### Week 1 TPT Actions

#### Tri 3 TPT 0.1 related to Beneficial and Harmful Effects of Computing Big Idea 5.1
1. Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing
     - When the computer saves your password, you won't have to worry about forgetting it but your computer is easier to hack
     - Online AP exams are great in a pandemic but not accessible to those affected by the Digital Divide
     - A smart home can make things easier but can be hacked
2. Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?
     - The Dopamine issues are real. I used to be distracted by reading books instead of doing my homework and a good schedule helped me address this problem

#### Tri 3 TPT 0.2 related to Digital Divide Big Idea 5.2
1. How does someone empower themself in a digital world?
     - Someone can empower themselves in a digital world by having access to devices like computers, phones, and tablet. Something that will empower people even more is
     knowledge of cybersecurity and coding.
2. How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.
     - Something we could do at Del Norte HS is teach free coding classes to people who cannot afford such classes/don't have access to them.
4. Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?
     - Yes, paper and red tape is blocking digital empowerment. At school, the wifi blocks certain websites. In some countries like Russia, the government censors websites and
     foreign content that impedes on people's digital empowerment.
     
#### Tri 3 TPT 1.0 Computing Bias 5.3
No, the owner does not thought think it was intentional. This is because whe felt that the raicsm is caused by the lack of diversity in the developers. The HP functionality worked out this way because most coders are males and white and when coding, they were using themselves as a testing data set. This is harmful because it is not representative of the World Population. It wasn't not intended to be harmful though. It should be correct. We can increase the scope and racial diversity of the data to produce a better outcome

#### Tri 3 TPT 1.1 Crowdsourcing 5.4
1. CompSci has 150 principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment?
One Crowdsource idea is to work together to make an AP CSP forum where students can get rapid feedback on their code.
2. Del Norte crowsources with grading through the peer grading process that AP science classes use. My final project could be better with crowsourcing as if I got more people to research how to code the forum, it would create a resource where many people can help others in a short frame of time.
 
#### Tri 3 TPT 2.0 Legal and Ethical Concerns 5.5
1. When you create a GitHub repository it requests a license type. Review the license types in relationship to this Tech Talk and make some notes in GitHub pages. 
- Licenses:
     - Creative Commons - waives copyright interest
     - Open Source MIT License - allows for coding freely and distributing closed source versions
     - Open Source GPL License - people can do anything they want to except distribute closed source versions
     - Github general public lcense is similar to other licenses as it allows for open access of information in a repo:
     like code, plans, issues, and contributors' information 
3. Make a license for your personal and Team project. Document license you picked and why.
     - I chose the MIT License because it lets users use my code but I get the credit

#### Tri 3 TPT 2.0 Safe Computing 5.6
1. Describe PII you have seen on project in CompSci Principles.
The dictionaries we made and entries we made in the List and Loops assignment is an example of PII in CompSci Principles.
2. What are your feelings about PII and your exposure?
I feel that given that there is an increase in hacking, more people should be aware about cybersecurity measures to protect sensitive PII.
3. Describe good and bad passwords? What is another step that is used to assist in authentication.
A good password is long, has characters and numbers, and is a password you haven't used before for another platform. Another step to assist in authentication is two-factor authentication (cofnirming entry though email)
4. Try to describe Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption.
Symmetric encryption encrypts a message so you and a recipient can read it. It uses a secret key which is used to encrypt and decrypt a message. Assymetric encryption is a process that used multiple keys to encrpyt and decrypt messages.
5. Provide and example of encryption we used in deployment.
The deployment manager inputs a key pair to deploy code.
6. Describe a phishing scheme you have learned about the hard way. Describe some other phishing techniques.
A phishing scheme is when a victim gets an email about "saving a Nigerian princess" and demands money.
