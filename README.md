# Test Prep Study

## 5.1 Notes
- The way people complete tasks changes to incorporate new computing innovations
- Not every effect of computing innovation is anticipated in advance
- A signle effect can be viewed as beneficial and harmful (like drones)
- Advances in computing have sparked creativity in other fields
- World Wide Web was originally intended for rapid and easy exchange of information 
- Targeted advertising is used to help businesses and can be misused at both individual and aggregate levels 
- Machine Learning and Data Mining have enabled innovation in medicine
- Some of the ways computing innovations can be used may have a harmful impact on society, the economy, or culture
- Responsible programmers try to consider unintended ways their computing innovations can be used and potential beneficial and harmful effects of these new uses
- It is not possible for a programer to consider all the ways a computing innovation can be used
- Computing innoivation have often had unintended beneficial effects by leading to advances in other fields
## 5.2 Notes
- Internet access varies between socioeconomic, geographic, and demographic characteristics, as well as between countries
- The "digital divide" refers to differing access to computing devices and the Internet, based on socioeconomic, geographic, or demographic characteristics
- The digital divde raises issues of equity, access, and infuence, both globally and locally
- The digital divide raises issues of equity, access, and influence, both globally and locally
- The digital divide is affected by the actions of individuals, organization, and governments
## 5.3 Notes
- Computing innocations can reflect existing human biases because of biases written into the algorithms or biases in the data used by the innovation
- Programmers should take action to reduce bias in algorithms used for computing innovations as a way of combating existing human biases
- Biases can be embedded at all levels of software development
## 5.4 Notes
- Widespread access to information and public data facilitates the identification of problems, developments of solutions, and dessemination of results
- Science has been affect by using distributed and "citizen science" to solve scientific problems
- Citizen science is scientific research conducted in whole or part by distributed individuals, many of whom may not be scienctists, who contribute relevant data to research using their own computing devices
- Crowdsourcing is the practice of obtaining input or information from a large number of people via the internet
- Human capabilities can be enhanced by collaboration via computing
- Crowdsourcing offers new models for collaboration, such as connecting businesses or social causes with funding

## Github Pages Actions
### Week 1 TPT Actions

#### Tri 3 TPT 0.1 related to Beneficial and Harmful Effects of Computing Big Idea 5.1
1. Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing
     - When the computer saves your password, you won't have to worry about forgetting it but your computer is easier to hack
     - Online AP exams are great in a pandemic but not accessible to those affected by the Digital Divide
     - A smart home can make things easier but can be hacked
3. Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?
     - The Dopamine issues are real. I used to be distracted by reading books instead of doing my homework and a good schedule helped me address this problem
#### Tri 3 TPT 0.2 related to Digital Divide Big Idea 5.2
1. How does someone empower themself in a digital world?
     - Someone can empower themselves in a digital world by having access to devices like computers, phones, and tablet. Something that will empower people even more is
     knowledge of cybersecurity and coding.
2. How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.
     - Something we could do at Del Norte HS is teach free coding classes to people who cannot afford such classes/don't have access to them.
4. Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?
     - Yes, paper and red tape is blocking digital empowerment. At school, the wifi blocks certain websites. In some countries like Russia, the government censors websites and
     foreign content that impedes on people's digital empowerment.
#### Tri 3 TPT 1.0 Computing Bias 5.3
No, the owner does not thought think it was intentional. This is because whe felt that the raicsm is caused by the lack of diversity in the developers. The HP functionality worked out this way because most coders are males and white and when coding, they were using themselves as a testing data set. This is harmful because it is not representative of the World Population. It wasn't not intended to be harmful though. It should be correct. We can increase the scope and racial diversity of the data to produce a better outcome
#### Tri 3 TPT 1.1 Crowdsourcing 5.4
1. CompSci has 150 principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment?
One Crowdsource idea is to work together to make an AP CSP forum where students can get rapid feedback on their code.
2. Del Norte crowsources with grading through the peer grading process that AP science classes use. My final project could be better with crowsourcing as if I got more people to research how to code the forum, it would create a resource where many people can help others in a short frame of time.
